# [somethingforyou.fyi](https://somethingforyou.fyi/)

This is a cute and simple [site](https://somethingforyou.fyi/) to reveal your feelings and ask out your crush, especially if you're shy or scared to do so in person. Go shoot your shot now!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Star this repo so that more people can discover this and ask out their crush!

### Motivation
You don't always have to build a complex SaaS toot or integration to help people. I wanted something *fun*, plus I really needed a break from a complex SaaS project I'm building (basically a [time tracker tool for devs](https://github.com/JLW-7/Milestone)), so I built this in the meantime. This gives you creative way to ask out the girl/guy of your dreams!

### Disclaimer
This is not guaranteed to work, but I promise you it's worth a try. 

### Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JS

This is your chance, good luck buddy :)
